# Description of the project

This is a dashboard created on Microsoft Power BI, showing the incidence of the COVID-19 virus in the EU from January 2020 to March 2022.

It focuses on the positive cases and deaths registered per each country and compares each selected country with the total situation in the EU.

It is structured with interactive slicers and maps, with helpful tooltips.
